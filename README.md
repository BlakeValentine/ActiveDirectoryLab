<h1>Running Active Directory | Adding Bulk Users with Powershell</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Hey there! In today's lab, we're going to dive into creating your very own Active Directory home lab using Oracle VirtualBox. It's like building your own little digital playground! This hands-on experience will give you a better grasp of how Active Directory works in Windows. I recommend going through this a couple of times to really get the workflow. Don't hesitate to reach out if you've got any questions â€“ I'm here to help!

<br />
<br />
Configure VM Network Settings. We are setting up two NICs for this lab. One is going to be used to connect to the internet and the other will be our clients internal private network :  <br/>

<h2>Guest Additions and TCP/IP Addressing:</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
Congratulations! You've installed Windows Server 2019. Navigate to Devices and select Insert Guest Additions CD image. This will add many quality of life improvements to the functionality of the VM.

<br />
<br />
In File Explorer you can access the CD Drive to launch the Guest Additions installer

<br />
<br />
Select VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64.exe

<br />
<br />
Now it's time to assign our IP Addressing. Remember our Domain Controller will have two NICs. The external one that is dedicated to the internet will receive an IP address through your home router. The internal NIC will need to be manually configured.
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/czCwcHS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Select change adapter options 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YCWdzz2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Confirm your external and internal NICs by checking their IP addresses. Remember, the internal NIC did not receive an IP address from DHCP so it will have 169.254 in the address.

<br />
<br />
Update the IP Addressing on our internal NIC to match the config sheet

<br />
<br />
We will now install Active Directory Domain Services
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hoh5SxT.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
This installation wizard will be used often as we add roles to the Domain Controller.

<br />
<br />
Select Active Directory Domain Services and proceed through the wizard. Close the installer when finished.
